# Surfs_Up

## Purpose for the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help us sell the Idea of opening a surf and ice cream shop in the beautiful island of Oahu. We have a possible investor in Mr. W. Avy and he wants us to show him how it will be feasible to run a shop not only in the warmer summer weather but also in the colder winter months.

## Results
What my analysis showed is that in the month of June the average temperature on Oahu is the mid 70’s and the average temperature in December is the low 70’s. Sure the temperature is 4-5 degrees cooler in the winter but what that means is the weather is always nice enough for some ice cream and surfing. 

We also investigated the precipitation of Oahu during these months, and it showed that the continuous rain fall chances are low. December’s rain fall average precipitation is 22% whereas June’s precipitation is 14%. What I would say is yes it rains but that will not ruin any chance of surfing and a slight chance that would stop the want for Ice cream. 

## Summary
In summary, Weather in Oahu is constant almost year around. With this knowledge I would surmise that even though summer is the optimal time for ice cream sales winter in Oahu will bring plenty of tourist in wanting to escape the cold of the winter in the contiguous USA and other parts of the world.
